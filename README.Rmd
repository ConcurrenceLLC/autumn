[![Travis-CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/r-lib/pkgdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aaronrudkin/autumn)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/aaronrudkin/autumn/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/aaronrudkin/autumn?branch=master)

Iterative proportional fitting (raking) is a straightforward and fast way to generate weights which ensure a dataset reflects known target marginal distributions: put simply, survey professionals use raking to ensure that samples represent the population they are drawn from.

Existing `R` implementations of raking are frustrating to use, have antiquated syntax, require external dependencies or compilation, have inadequate documentation, generate difficult to understand errors, run slowly, and don't support "tidy" workflows. **autumn** is a modern package built from the ground up to fix these problems.

## Installation

**autumn** will be submitted to CRAN in January 2020. In the meantime, you can install it using the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install GitHub version:
devtools::install_github("aaronrudkin/autumn")
```

## Usage

The workhorse function of **autumn** is `harvest()`, which takes at minimum two arguments: 1) a data.frame (or tibble) containing data; 2) target proportions. At its simplest, a call to `harvest()` works as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Standard R function call
harvest(respondent_data, ns_target)

# Using `magrittr`'s pipe operator
respondent_data %>% harvest(ns_target)
```

It just works! This function call will iteratively weight observations to match the target proportions and add a column `weights` to the data frame (it is also possible to rename the column or return the weights as a vector). Default parameters are helpful and sane: weights are guaranteed mean 1 and maximum 5.

### Specifying a Target

The main challenge when running `harvest()` is to correctly specify target proportions. Two formats are supported: 1) a list of named vectors; 2) a data.frame or tibble.

When supplying targets as a list of named vectors, it looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
list(
  gender = c(Male = 0.4829, Female = 0.5171), 
  region = c(Midwest = 0.2086, 
             Northeast = 0.1764, 
             South = 0.3775, 
             West = 0.2374)
)
```

Each list element should match the name of a single variable in the data, and each vector name should match a value the variable can take. The numeric values should be positive and sum to 1 within each variable.

When supplying data as a data.frame or tibble, the data.frame should have three columns (by default `harvest()` looks for columns named "variable", "level", and "proportion" -- although these names can be overridden):
```{r echo=FALSE}
target_tbl = as_tibble(autumn:::list_targets_to_df(ns_target[c("gender", "region")])) %>% mutate(proportion = round(proportion, 4))
```
```{r}
target_tbl
```

### Advanced Usage

**autumn** supports a variety of advanced features including:

- Supplying starting weights
- Adjusting maximum weights
- Adjusting convergence and iteration criteria
- Adjusting variable selection and error calculation criteria
- Handling missing data appropriately
- Calculating design effects for produced weights
- Summarizing raking results

## Speed `r emo::ji("rocket")`

How fast is **autumn**? Fast. 

Below, we present results of three different benchmark scenarios, each using real data (the first two benchmarks use the `respondent_data` and `ns_target` datasets included with **autumn**). All of these benchmarks use identical data and default parameterizations, and were run on a low power 2016-vintage personal computer. The larger the the dataset and the more complicated the rake, the more you benefit from using **autumn**. Customizing convergence criteria to allow for earlier termination can result in further speed improvements over existing software.

*Note:* 

### Small scale

This benchmark generates weights for a dataset of 6,691 observations, raking on 10 variables. Compared with the implementation in **anesrake**, **autumn** is about *67% faster* and allocates one third less memory. Compared with the implementation in **survey**, **autumn** is about *4X as fast* and allocates 20% more memory.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Pre-compute the result above on real data and store as a pre-made expression
# so that we can 
result_small_benchmark = structure(list(expression = c("autumn", "anesrake", "survey"), 
    min = structure(c(1.34557561800001, 2.462163475, 4.56870103200001
    ), class = c("bench_time", "numeric")), median = structure(c(1.73368290000001, 
    2.892148122, 6.756519067), class = c("bench_time", "numeric"
    )), `itr/sec` = c(0.572472241007729, 0.314504693882058, 0.147574009494806
    ), mem_alloc = structure(c(774216136, 1189511664, 644706568
    ), class = c("bench_bytes", "numeric")), `gc/sec` = c(3.00547926529058, 
    2.42483118983067, 0.866259435734511), n_itr = c(100L, 100L, 
    100L)), class = c("bench_mark", "tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"
), row.names = c(NA, -3L))

result_small_benchmark
```

### Medium scale

Consider a raking task that is more difficult to converge: the same dataset (6,691 observations) raked on 17 variables. The extra variables involve interactions which greatly complicate convergence. **autumn** is *three times as fast* as **anesrake** and uses almost two thirds less memory (**survey** will not complete the rake):

```{r echo=FALSE}
result_big_benchmark = structure(list(expression = c("autumn", "anesrake"), min = structure(c(2.29740926100001, 
8.409736236), class = c("bench_time", "numeric")), median = structure(c(3.0174227935, 
9.993015223), class = c("bench_time", "numeric")), `itr/sec` = c(0.327217747698054, 
0.0945252613310439), mem_alloc = structure(c(1305062264, 3338550552
), class = c("bench_bytes", "numeric")), `gc/sec` = c(6.57707672873089, 
4.76974468676447), n_itr = c(100L, 100L), n_gc = c(2010, 5046
)), class = c("bench_mark", "tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"), row.names = c(NA, 
-2L))

result_big_benchmark
```

### Large scale

Finally, consider an extremely resource intensive problem: raking a much larger dataset of 108,660 observations on 17 variables. In this scenario, **autumn** is 11 times faster and uses 92% less memory. (This benchmark is limited to 10 iterations):

```{r echo=FALSE}
# result_mega_benchmark = bench::mark(
#   "autumn" = { autumn::harvest(result_mega, ns_target) },
#   "anesrake" = { anesrake::anesrake(ns_target,
#                                     junk_data_mega,
#                                     junk_data_mega$ResponseID) },
#   check = FALSE,
#   min_iterations = 10
# ) %>% select(1:8) %>%
#   mutate(expression = c("autumn", "anesrake"))

result_mega_benchmark = structure(list(expression = c("autumn", "anesrake"), min = structure(c(47.098076077, 
489.156242585), class = c("bench_time", "numeric")), median = structure(c(48.7915496325, 
527.8651931685), class = c("bench_time", "numeric")), `itr/sec` = c(0.0200139846259755, 
0.00189092458918188), mem_alloc = structure(c(22328143016, 256220489208
), class = c("bench_bytes", "numeric")), `gc/sec` = c(2.43570192898122, 
2.52211521705079), n_itr = c(10L, 10L), n_gc = c(1217, 13338)), class = c("bench_mark", 
"tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"), row.names = c(NA, -2L))

result_mega_benchmark
```
